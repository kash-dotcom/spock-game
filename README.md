## User Experience 

In a game a chance, users are allowed to try their luck to beat the computer. The design allows users to understand what the game is and how to play without leaving the browser. Although are words, it is possible to use the game with limited English. 

# Design
Canva was used to make a mock-up that included wireframe and design elements. This mock-up helped to decide the layout, divisions, IDs, classes, and colour scheme.

## Colour Palette

The colours are taken from a still image of The Big Bang Theory. When the player selects one of the buttons, it is shown above the scorecard with a cut-out version, using the same colours of the buttons but in reverse.

## Typography 

Three Google fonts are used in the project:
* **Font Awesome** Used for all icons and symbols for their simplicity and consistency.

* **Orbitron** giving it a Star Trek-like feel.
* **Handjet** with its pixelated look resembling the poor-quality graphics of the 80s, suiting the characters of The Big Bang Theory.
* **Roboto Mono** an easy-to-read font that allows users to read about the game’s origin and look at the 10 different possible outcomes.
